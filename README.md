### Inspiration

As the **director**, **project manager**, and **developer** of「**Virtuosos**」, I made an unique blend of rhythm and JRPG elements, incorporating influences from several my beloved games and anime:

* **Muse Dash**
  * One of the key inspirations for the gameplay mechanics in「Virtuosos」comes from the popular game [Muse Dash](https://musedash.peropero.net/#/).

  * We were drawn to the classic horizontal screen layout of "Muse Dash" and how it enhances the rhythmic gameplay. This influence led us to adopt a similar layout, allowing players to engage with the game's musical elements in an exciting way.

* **NieR: Automata**
  * When it comes to world-building and storytelling, I found inspiration in the exceptional game [NieR: Automata](https://nierautomata.square-enix-games.com/en-us/home/).

  * The dystopian themes and intricate narrative of "NieR: Automata" resonated with us deeply, and we aimed to infuse a similar sense of depth and intrigue into the world of「Virtuosos」. As players progress through the game's various levels and encounters, they will uncover a rich and immersive story that will keep them engaged and eager to explore further.

* **Made in Abyss & Girls' Last Tour**
  * In terms of art direction, we took inspiration from two distinct anime series. [Made in Abyss](http://miabyss.com/) provided a visual inspiration with its detailed and atmospheric environments, while [Girls' Last Tour](http://girls-last-tour.com/) influenced us with its minimalist yet evocative background art style.

  * By combining elements from these two anime, we aimed to create a visually stunning world within「Virtuosos」that would draw players in and enhance their overall gaming experience.

### Gameplay
As a [JRPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games#Japanese_role-playing_games) rhythm game, 「Virtuosos」 combines the style of Japanese role-playing games with elements of rhythm games. Within different levels of the game, players will discover the background stories of various characters and their environments, gradually exploring new gameplay mechanics. And of course, they will be able to indulge in the joy of music!

#### Music Performance
The heart of 「Virtuosos」 lies in its immersive music performance gameplay. Players step into the role of talented musicians and embark on a quest to master rhythms and melodies. Through carefully timed inputs and precise execution, players must perform musical sequences to progress through levels and overcome challenges.

On the other side, players are invited to embark on an immersive journey through a rich and captivating story. Dialogues and Narrtives will provide deeper insights into the world of Virtuosos, allowing players to develop connections with the characters and become fully immersed in the narrative.
